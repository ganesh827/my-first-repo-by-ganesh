 Topic:  **smarter ai powered spam classifier**

With the advancements in deep learning and AI, handling spam content has become easier and more efficient. This project aims to build a spam classifier using Keras1. The spam classifier is designed to handle spam content with high accuracy and produce minimal erroneous results1. The project is part of a multi-part series that covers various aspects of building an AI model, integrating a NoSQL database for inference result storing, and deploying the AI model into production1.

The project utilizes a dataset of spam content and non-spam content, which is prepared and converted into trainable vectors1. The dataset is combined from two different spam datasets1. The training dataset is then used to train the AI model, which includes layers such as Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Embedding, LSTM, and SpatialDropout1D1. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras1.

The abstract provides an overview of the project and its objectives. For more detailed information and step-by-step instructions, you can refer to the original project notebook1.

Please note that the abstract is a summary and does not cover all the technical details of the project. It is advisable to refer to the original project resources for a comprehensive understanding of the implementation.
